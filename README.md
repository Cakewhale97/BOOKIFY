BOOKIFY
BOOKIFY is a React Native application designed to help users track their reading. Users can create an account, sign in, save books they want to read, add books they've read, and rate books. The data is stored in Firebase. The project is still in development, with a goal to leverage machine learning through Python to create an algorithm that suggests books to users based on their preferences.
